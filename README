Detect optimal MTU sizes.

This program takes two IP addresses, one local and one remote, and adjusts the
MTU of both interfaces using SSH with passwordless shared keys. It tests and
records the performance at the various MTUs and reports in simple ASCII art
graphs the results of the test. Benchmarking is done using iperf.

For best results, both local and remote machine's IPs should be on the same
type of network hardware.
